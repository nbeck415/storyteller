"Shh... SEE?I would never, ever discuss it."<br><br>

Sarcastic.<br><br>

"But... uh... I'm going to... join the leader group. I need to get some coffee."<br><br>

"I was a little... off. But it was nice to meet you."<br><br>

Sarcastic flash came across my lips as I began to sugarcoat my words.<br><br>

"I'd had a good day!"<br><br>

The words were coming steadily. They were coming fast.<br><br>

They had come not overnight. It had taken me years. It had taken the last three months.<br><br>

"I have hope," I said, "of the ground underneath me. What is the hidden meaning behind this situation?"<br><br>


"I will tell you my secret," Loki said, "But the whole thing is a lie."<br><br>


"It can't be any other way," said Sherwood
